During the Kode With Klossy Mobile App Development Camp, I created my first application—an 'About Me' project—using SwiftUI in Xcode. This experience allowed me to gain foundational skills in iOS development, including implementing layout structures with VStack, HStack, and ZStack, importing and displaying images, and utilizing modifiers to customize typography, color, and spacing. The final product presents my hobbies, interests, and personal facts within a streamlined user interface built entirely in the ContentView."
